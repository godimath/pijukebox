##Installation##

Copy pijukebox.conf into /etc/, and modify the [Location] directive to point to the location of pijukebox (Default users home)
Do NOT add a trailing slash unless you want to go fix all the code :)

Make initpijukebox.sh get called on boot:

	-Add the following line to /etc/rc.local:
	
		/path/to/pijukebox/initpijukebox.sh &
	
	-Don't forget the ampersand and the end. If you do the system will wait for the script to finish
	 before continuing to boot, which it won't, so the system will hang. 

Point your web server to serve /path/to/pijukebox/webpage

Add a timer for the backlight by add the following to /etc/crontab

	*/1 * * * * root /usr/bin/python /path/to/pijukebox/scripts/python/updateScreen.py BOFF
